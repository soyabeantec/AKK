Elasticsearch
The heart of the Elastic Stack

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

Query & Analyze
Ask your data questions of all kinds

Elasticsearch lets you perform and combine many types of searches — structured, unstructured, geo, metric — any way you want. Start simple with one question and see where it takes you. It’s one thing to find the 10 best documents to match your query. But how do you make sense of, say, a billion log lines? Elasticsearch aggregations let you zoom out to explore trends and patterns in your data.
Speed
Elasticsearch is fast. Really, really fast.

When you get answers instantly, your relationship with your data changes. You can afford to iterate and cover more ground.

Being this fast isn't easy. We've implemented inverted indices with finite state transducers for full-text querying, BKD trees for storing numeric and geo data, and a column store for analytics.

And since everything is indexed, you're never left with index envy. You can leverage and access all of your data at ludicrously awesome speeds.
Scalability
Run it on your laptop. Or hundreds of servers with petabytes of data.

Go from prototype to production seamlessly; you talk to Elasticsearch running on a single node the same way you would in a 300-node cluster.

It scales horizontally to handle kajillions of events per second, while automatically managing how indices and queries are distributed across the cluster for oh-so-smooth operations.
Relevance
Search across everything. Find that specific thing.

Rank your search results based on a variety of factors — from term frequency or recency to popularity and beyond. Mix and match these along with functions to fine tune how your results show up to your users.

And because most of our users are human, Elasticsearch is equipped to handle human mistakes including complexities like typos.
Resiliency
We cover the bases while you swing for the fences.

Hardware rebels. Networks partition. Elasticsearch detects failures to keep your cluster (and your data) safe and available. With cross-cluster replication, a secondary cluster can spring into action as a hot backup. Elasticsearch operates in a distributed environment designed from the ground up for perpetual peace of mind.
Use Cases
What exactly can I use Elasticsearch for?

Numbers, text, geo, structured, unstructured. All data types are welcome. Full-text search just scratches the surface of how companies around the world are relying on Elasticsearch to solve a variety of challenges. See a full list of solutions built directly on the Elastic Stack.
