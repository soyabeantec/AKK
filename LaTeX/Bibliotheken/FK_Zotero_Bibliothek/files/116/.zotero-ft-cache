    These videos will introduce the Qlik  Sense application by taking you on a tour of the various views which allow you to build and interact with apps.  A configured example is used in the video, and the intent is for you to follow-along with each step of the demonstration as the various views and icons are related.  The result of the experience will be the construction of a map, which you can download and refer to as you acclimate to the Qlik Sense environment.
