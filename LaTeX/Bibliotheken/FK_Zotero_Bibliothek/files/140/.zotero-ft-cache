Frequently asked questions

Is there special pricing for nonprofit and educational organizations?

Yes, we offer pricing for nonprofit and educational organizations .

What is your cancellation policy? Are there refunds?

You can cancel a paid plan at any time by accessing the account settings in your account dashboard. We recommend modifying your subscription at least a couple of days before the next scheduled payment. You'll be able to access the advanced features until the end of your subscription period. We do not offer refunds (as detailed in our Terms of Service )

Can I create an Infogram account with multiple users? What is the pricing?

Yes, we offer Infogram Team Accounts with multiple users. You can choose the Enterprise plan or Team Account feature with a Business subscription plan. Pricing depends on team size (and it's better than getting single accounts). If you go over the team size limit, you will receive a notification to upgrade to the next team size tier. All your projects will remain available. Contact us at sales@infogr.am for more information.

What is the subscription period?

Paid plans can be purchased on monthly or yearly recurring payments. Paid accounts can be cancelled at any time and the advanced features will remain available until the end of the subscription period.

Can I use Infogram for commercial purposes?

For use by companies, organizations and professionals, we require the use of one of our paid plans (Pro, Business, or Enterprise), which also include higher limits of usage and many features which make these product levels more powerful. Infogram's Basic plan is intended only for non-commercial use, such as personal projects, blogs and presentations, within the limits of fair use.

What are your data security and privacy policies?

We take data security and privacy issues very seriously. Our system keeps all user data in secure, mirrored servers with a historical uptime of 99.8%. If you publish an project, it can be accessed and found by search engines. Our Pro and Business plans give you the option of sharing your projects privately with a password. For even more security, keep your projects private and download them as PDFs or images (available with our Pro and Business plans) for private use.

What are the payment options?

We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal. For invoicing terms for annual subscriptions, please contact us at sales@infogr.am

Is it possible to remove Infogram's logo from the bottom of an project? Can I add my own logo?

Our Business plan allows you to remove Infogram's branding and add your own logo (as a 180x50 px PNG image).
