Review of 20 best big data visualization tools
Posted on Sep 19, 2017 Jan 5, 2019 Author Edoardo L’Astorina

B ig Data is amazing. It describes our everyday behavior, keeps track of the places we go, stores what we like to do and how much time we spend doing our favorite activities. Big Data is made of numbers, and I think we all agree when we say:

Numbers are difficult to look at.

Enter Big Data  visualization .

Google ,  Facebook ,  Amazon ,  Apple ,  Twitter  and  Netflix  all ask better questions of their data – and make better business decisions – by using data visualization.

It gets better:

Data visualization lets you  interact  with data. It goes beyond analysis. Visualization brings a presentation to life. It keeps your audience’s eyes on the screen. And gets people interested.

You might be wondering:

How do I get a clean and engaging visualization for all my data? Will it be time consuming? Am I going to spend months preparing everything?

Here’s the deal:

There are tools that help you visualize all your data in  minutes . They are already out there. All you need to do is pick the right tool that suits your needs.

Whether you’re looking to wow your audience at your next presentation or you are a developer looking for a practical way to visualize large sets of data, there are amazing tools out there for both parties. So many that it’s hard to find the right tool for your project.

Want to know the best part?

We made everything easy for you and prepared a series of reviews that cover all the features of the best data visualization tools out there. And we divided our reviews in two sections: data visualization tools for presentations and data visualization tools for developers.

Here are reviews of our 20 best tools for Big Data visualization.
For Presentations: Zero Coding Required

Your data is all in a spreadsheet. Ready to go. All you want is to visualize it beautifully and maybe add a few smart interactions. And make a killer presentation. If this is you read on and enjoy our list of amazing data visualization tools for presentations.
Tableau

Tableau

Tableau is  the  big data visualization tool for corporate. Tableau lets you create charts, graphs, maps and many other graphics. A desktop app is available for visual analytics. Don’t want – or can’t – install software on your desktop? A server solution lets you visualize reports online and on mobile. A cloud hosted service is also an option for those who want the server solution… but don’t want to set it up manually. Customers of Tableau include Barclays ,  Pandora  and  Citrix .
Infogram

Infogram

Infogram lets you link their visualizations and infographics to  real time  big data. And that’s a big plus. A simple 3-step process lets you choose among many templates, personalize them with additional visualizations like charts, map, images and even videos, and you are ready to share your visualization. Infogram supports team accounts for media publishers and for journalists, branded designs for companies and classroom accounts for educational projects.
ChartBlocks

ChartBlocks

ChartBlocks is an easy-to-use online tool that requires no coding, and builds visualizations from spreadsheets, databases… and live feeds. A chart building wizard does all the magic for you. Your chart will be created under the hood in HTML5 by using the powerful JavaScript library D3.js – read our developers review of D3.js below – and your visualizations will be responsive and compatible with any screen size and device. You will also be able to embed your charts in any web page and share it on Twitter and Facebook.
Datawrapper

Datawrapper

Datawrapper is aimed squarely at publishers and journalists and is adopted by  The Washington Post ,  The Guardian ,  Vox ,  BuzzFeed ,  The Wall Street Journal  and Twitter – among the many. Datawrapper is easy and requires zero coding. Upload your data and easily create and publish a chart or even a map. Custom layouts to integrate your visualizations perfectly on your site and access to local area maps are also available.
Plotly

Plotly

Plotly will help you create a sharp and slick chart in just a few minutes, starting from a simple spreadsheet. Plotlyis used by none other than the guys at Google and also by  The U.S. Air Force ,  Goji  and  The New York University . Plotly is a very user-friendly web tool that gets you started in minutes. If you have a team of developers that wants to have a crack, an API is available for languages that include JavaScript and  Python .
RAW

raw

RAW boasts on its homepage to be “the missing link between spreadsheets and vector graphics”. Your Big Data can come from Microsoft Excel, Google Docs, Apple Numbers or a simple comma-separated list. The kicker here is that you can export your visualization easily and have a designer make it look sharp as RAW is compatiple with Adobe Illustrator, Sketch and Inkscape. Easy to use and quick to get results.
Visual.ly

Visual.ly

Visual.ly is a visual content service. I decided to include it because they do have a  dedicated big data visualization service  and their portfolio is impressive: it includes work for  VISA ,  Nike , Twitter,  The Huffington Post ,  Ford  and  The National Geographic . If you want to entirely outsource your visualizations to a third-party you can do it through a streamlined online process where you describe your project and are connected with a creative team that will stay with you for the entire duration of the project. Visual.ly send you email notifications for all the milestones you are hitting, and will also let you give constant feedback to your creative team. Visual.ly also offer their distribution network for showcasing your project once it’s completed.

For Developers: JavaScript libraries

And here is our developers list. This is for when all your data is in JSON or XML. You love APIs. You want to create gorgeous interactive data visualizations, put them on a web page and let the world see. JavaScript knowledge is highly recommended to make it through our developers list of extraordinary data visualization libraries.
D3.js

d3js

The best data visualization library there is, D3.js runs on JavaScript and uses HTML, CSS and SVG. D3.js is open-source and applies data-driven transformation to a webpage and – as you can see from their examples – allows for beautiful and fast visualizations. D3.js is also the absolute best to add data-driven real-time interactivity. Warning: this library is as powerful as it is cutting-edge, so it comes with no pre-built charts and only IE9+ is supported.
Ember Charts

Ember Charts

Ember Charts is – as the name suggests – based on the  Ember.js  framework and uses D3.js under the hood.Ember Charts features time series, bar, pie and scatter charts. It’s very elegant and easy to extend. The team behind Ember Charts – the same that created Ember.js – put a lot of focus on best practices and interactivity. Error handling is graceful and your app will not crash when fed bad data.
NVD3

NVD3

NVD3 runs on top of D3.js – surprise surprise – and aims to build re-usable charts and components. The goal of the project is to keep all your charts neat and customizable.

NVD3 is developed by the front end engineers at  Novus Partners  and uses their insight in charting technology.
Google Charts

Chart.js

chartjs

For a small chart project, Chart.js is your go-to place. Open source, tiny – ships at only 11kb – fast, easy to use, it supports six chart types: doughnut, pie, polar, line, bar and radar. What’s more, you can add and remove any of these 6 types to reduce your footprint. Chart.js uses HTML5 Canvas and ships with polyfills for IE6/7 support.

n3-charts

n3-charts

n3-charts is for the AngularJS lovers out there. It’s built on top of D3.js and helps your data visualization come to life with simple and interactive charts. n3-charts is for a niche of AngularJS developers who want minimal, easy and elegant chart visualizations.

Sigma JS

Sigma JS

Sigma JS is what you want for interactivity. It comes out-of-the-box with mouse and touch support, refreshing and rescaling, and renders on  WebGL  by default with an HTML5 Canvas fallback.

Polymaps

Polymaps

Polymaps visualizes…. you guessed it: maps. Polymaps is a JavaScript library that uses SVG to represent geographical data from country-wide level all the way down to your local street. You use CSS rules to style your visualization and your data can be easily interpreted by Polymaps via the  GeoJSON  standard. This is the best tool there is if you’re after creating heatmaps. All the maps you create can be interactive. And you can visualize cartography from OpenStreetMap,  CloudMade ,  Bing  and many other maps providers.
Processing.js

ProcessingJS

Processing.js is a JavaScript library that sits on top of the  Processing  visual programming language. As everyJavaSript library is, Processing.js is web oriented and lets you bring the Processing power to your web pages. This is the smartest visual interactive library there is.
