Put Mapping edit

The PUT mapping API allows you to add fields to an existing index or to change search only settings of existing fields.

 PUT twitter     {} PUT twitter / _mapping     {  "properties" :  {  "email" :  {  "type" :  "keyword"  }  }  } 

Copy as cURL View in Console  

	

Creates an index called twitter without any mapping.

	

Uses the PUT mapping API to add a new field called email .

More information on how to define mappings can be found in the mapping section.
Note

Before 7.0.0, the mappings definition used to include a type name. Although specifying types in requests is now deprecated, a type can still be provided if the request parameter include_type_name is set. For more details, please see Removal of mapping types .
Multi-index edit

The PUT mapping API can be applied to multiple indices with a single request. For example, we can update the twitter-1 and twitter-2 mappings at the same time:

 # Create the two indices PUT twitter - 1 PUT twitter - 2  # Update both mappings PUT  / twitter - 1 , twitter - 2 / _mapping     {  "properties" :  {  "user_name" :  {  "type" :  "text"  }  }  } 

Copy as cURL View in Console  

	

Note that the indices specified ( twitter-1,twitter-2 ) follows multiple index names and wildcard format.
Updating field mappings edit

In general, the mapping for existing fields cannot be updated. There are some exceptions to this rule. For instance:

    new properties can be added to Object fields.
    new multi-fields can be added to existing fields.
    the ignore_above parameter can be updated.

For example:

 PUT my_index     {  "mappings" :  {  "properties" :  {  "name" :  {  "properties" :  {  "first" :  {  "type" :  "text"  }  }  },  "user_id" :  {  "type" :  "keyword"  }  }  }  } PUT my_index / _mapping  {  "properties" :  {  "name" :  {  "properties" :  {  "last" :  {     "type" :  "text"  }  }  },  "user_id" :  {  "type" :  "keyword" ,  "ignore_above" :  100     }  }  } 

Copy as cURL View in Console  

	

Create an index with a first field under the name Object field, and a user_id field.

	

Add a last field under the name object field.

	

Update the ignore_above setting from its default of 0.

Each mapping parameter specifies whether or not its setting can be updated on an existing field.
